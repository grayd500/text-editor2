# Progressive Web Applications Challenge: Text Editor

## Description

This project was undertaken with the goal of developing a reliable and efficient text editor that runs in the browser. The motivation behind this endeavor was to create a tool that allows developers to create notes or code snippets with or without an internet connection, ensuring their work is reliably saved and accessible for later use. Throughout this project, I learned about the implementation of data persistence techniques, especially IndexedDB, and the nuances of creating a Progressive Web Application (PWA).
