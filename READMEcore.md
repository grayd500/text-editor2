Progressive Web Applications (PWA) Challenge: Text Editor
As you have progressed through this course, you have put together a number of impressive projects that you can show off to potential employers. This project is no exception; in fact, it features some of the most impressive expressions of the concepts you have learned so far.

Your task is to build a text editor that runs in the browser. The app will be a single-page application that meets the PWA criteria. Additionally, it will feature a number of data persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. The application will also function offline.

To build this text editor, you will start with an existing application and implement methods for getting and storing data to an IndexedDB database. You will use a package called idb, which is a lightweight wrapper around the IndexedDB API. It features a number of methods that are useful for storing and retrieving data, and is used by companies like Google and Mozilla.

You will deploy this full-stack application to Render using the Render Deployment Guide on The Full-Stack BlogLinks to an external site..

## User Story
AS A developer
I WANT to create notes or code snippets with or without an internet connection
SO THAT I can reliably retrieve them for later use

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a text editor web application

WHEN I open my application in my editor
🚧THEN I should see a client server folder structure

WHEN I run `npm run start` from the root directory
🚧THEN I find that my application should start up the backend and serve the client

WHEN I run the text editor application from my terminal
🚧THEN I find that my JavaScript files have been bundled using webpack

WHEN I run my webpack plugins
🚧THEN I find that I have a generated HTML file, service worker, and a manifest file

WHEN I use next-gen JavaScript in my application
🚧THEN I find that the text editor still functions in the browser without errors

WHEN I open the text editor
🚧THEN I find that IndexedDB has immediately created a database storage

WHEN I enter content and subsequently click off of the DOM window
✅THEN I find that the content in the text editor has been saved with IndexedDB

WHEN I reopen the text editor after closing it
✅THEN I find that the content in the text editor has been retrieved from our IndexedDB

WHEN I click on the Install button
🚧THEN I download my web application as an icon on my desktop

WHEN I load my web application
🚧THEN I should have a registered service worker using workbox

WHEN I register a service worker
🚧THEN I should have my static assets pre cached upon loading along with subsequent pages and static assets

WHEN I deploy to Render
🚧THEN I should have proper build scripts for a webpack application

Mock-Up
The following animation demonstrates the application functionality:

Grading:
Technical Acceptance Criteria: 40%
Satisfies all of the above acceptance criteria plus the following:

Uses IndexedDB to create an object store and includes both GET and PUT methods

The application works without an internet connection

Automatically saves content inside the text editor when the DOM window is unfocused

Bundled with webpack

Create a service worker with workbox that Caches static assets

The application should use babel in order to use async / await

Application must have a generated manifest.json using the WebpackPwaManifest plug-in

Can be installed as a Progressive Web Application

How to Submit the Challenge
You are required to submit BOTH of the following for review:

The URL of the functional, deployed application.

The URL of the GitHub repository. Give the repository a unique name and include a README describing the project.
